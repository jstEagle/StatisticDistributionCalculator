                        In a survey, it is found that 25% of customers purchase a particular product. The random variable Y represents the number of customers who purchase the product from a sample of 8 customers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        1. Write down the 4 conditions for Y to be modeled as a binomial random variable <br>
                        - 2 outcomes <br>
                        - random <br>
                        - independent <br>
                        - fixed number of trials <br>
                        <br>

                        2. Find the probability that exactly 3 customers purchase the product <br>
                        \(p(Y = 3) = \binom{8}{3} (0.25)^3(0.75)^5\) <br>
                        \(= 0.250\) <br>
                        <br>

                        3. Find the probability that at least 6 customers purchase the product <br>
                        \(p(Y \ge 6) = 1 - p(Y < 6)\) <br>
                        \(= 0.076\) <br>
                        <br>

                        4. Find the probability that fewer than 2 customers purchase the product <br>
                        \(p(Y < 2) = \sum_{y=0}^{1} \binom{8}{y} (0.25)^y(0.75)^{8-y}\) <br>

                        A company conducts a quality control test on its products, where 80% of the products pass the test. The random variable Y represents the number of products that pass from a batch of 20 products.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        1. State the conditions for Y to follow a binomial distribution. <br>
                        - Two possible outcomes: pass or fail <br>
                        - Each product is tested independently <br>
                        - The probability of passing is constant (80% in this case) <br>
                        - Fixed number of trials (20 products in each batch) <br>
                        <br>

                        2. Find the probability that exactly 16 products pass the test. <br>
                        \(p(Y = 16) = \binom{20}{16} (0.8)^{16}(0.2)^4\) <br>

                        \(p(Y \le 18) = \sum_{y=0}^{18} \binom{20}{y} (0.8)^y(0.2)^{20-y}\) <br>
                        \(= 0.977\) <br>
                        <br>

                        4. Determine the probability that more than 14 products pass the test. <br>
                        \(p(Y > 14) = 1 - p(Y \le 14)\) <br>
                        \(1 - (\sum_{y=0}^{14} \binom{20}{y} (0.8)^y(0.2)^{20-y})\) <br>

                        A survey suggests that 60% of people prefer tea over coffee. A cafe decides to survey 10 customers and record their preference. Let the random variable Z represent the number of customers who prefer tea.

                        1. What is the probability that exactly 7 out of 10 customers prefer tea? <br>
                        \(p(Z = 7) = \binom{10}{7} (0.6)^7(0.4)^3\) <br>

                        2. Find the probability that at least 5 customers prefer tea. <br>
                        \(p(Z \geq 5) = 1 - p(Z < 5)\) <br>

                        \(p(Z < 4) = \sum_{z=0}^{3} \binom{10}{z} (0.6)^z(0.4)^{10-z}\) <br>
